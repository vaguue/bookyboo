- Next.js App Router
- Optimized for SEO using Next.js's Metadata
- React Server Components (RSCs) and Suspense
- Server Actions for mutations
- Edge Runtime
- New fetching and caching paradigms
- Dynamic OG images
- Styling with Tailwind CSS
- Checkout and payments with Shopify
- Automatic light/dark mode based on system settings

## LemonSqueezy
[LemonSqueezy](https://www.lemonsqueezy.com/) is a payments, tax & subscriptions service for software companies, that enables the most convinient and smooth integration for commercial projects online. Checkout their [Github](https://github.com/lmsqueezy) page for more details.

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js Commerce. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control your Shopify store.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
